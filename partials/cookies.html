  <p><strong>Last updated:</strong> 01 November 2025</p>

  <p>
    We use cookies, local storage, and similar technologies to keep the site secure and understand how people use it.
    Some are essential for functionality; others help us measure performance and improve the experience.
  </p>

  <h3>Types we use</h3>
  <ul>
    <li>
      <strong>Strictly necessary</strong> (always on): required for security, spam protection (Cloudflare Turnstile),
      and core functionality such as remembering form progress and preventing duplicate submissions.
    </li>
    <li>
      <strong>Analytics</strong> (optional): Google Analytics&nbsp;4 (GA4) and Microsoft&nbsp;Clarity record anonymised
      usage patterns, page paths, and form-step progress to help us identify drop-off points and improve usability.
      Set only if you accept.
    </li>
    <li>
      <strong>Advertising / measurement</strong> (optional): Meta&nbsp;Pixel helps us understand which adverts lead to
      completed forms (“Leads”). It may share pseudonymised browser data and hashed contact details (email/phone)
      when you submit the form. Set only if you accept analytics.
    </li>
    <li>
      <strong>Local / session storage</strong> (functional): used only within your browser and not shared with any
      third parties.
      <ul>
        <li><code>vlm_cookie_consent</code> – remembers your analytics choice for up to 12&nbsp;months.</li>
        <li><code>lead_event_id</code>, <code>lead_fired</code> – prevent duplicate “Lead” tracking events.</li>
        <li><code>phone_e164</code> – normalises phone numbers before submission.</li>
      </ul>
    </li>
  </ul>

  <h3>How consent works</h3>
  <p>
    When the cookie banner appears you can <strong>Accept analytics</strong> or <strong>Reject</strong>.
    <br>
    Accept → GA4, Clarity, and Meta&nbsp;Pixel load and record usage.
    <br>
    Reject → only strictly necessary cookies and local storage run; analytics scripts stay blocked.
  </p>
  <p>
    Your choice is stored in <code>vlm_cookie_consent</code> for up to 12&nbsp;months. You can change it at any time:
  </p>
  <p>
    <a href="#" id="change-cookie-settings" class="btn-link" data-cookie-settings>Change cookie settings</a>
  </p>

  <h3>Data sharing & storage</h3>
  <ul>
    <li><strong>Google&nbsp;Analytics&nbsp;4</strong> – hosted by Google&nbsp;LLC (US / EU). IP anonymisation enabled.</li>
    <li><strong>Microsoft&nbsp;Clarity</strong> – provides anonymised heatmaps and recordings; no payment or identifying data captured.</li>
    <li><strong>Meta&nbsp;Pixel / Conversions&nbsp;API</strong> – measures ad performance and form submissions (“Lead” events)
      using hashed identifiers and a secure server connection.</li>
    <li><strong>Airtable / Make.com</strong> – process submitted form data internally; they do not set cookies on your device.</li>
  </ul>

  <h3>Managing your preferences</h3>
  <p>
    You can accept or reject analytics at any time using the link above or by clearing cookies in your browser.
    Rejecting analytics will not affect your ability to complete or submit a form.
