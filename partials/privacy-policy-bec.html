<h3>Privacy Policy — Business Energy Claims (Unregulated Service)</h3>

<p><strong>Important:</strong> Business energy claims are <strong>not regulated by the Financial Conduct Authority</strong>. This privacy policy applies to our unregulated business energy claims service only.</p>

<h3>1. Who We Are</h3>
<p>Visible Legal Marketing Limited ("we", "us", "our") provides a business energy claims service. <strong>We are NOT regulated by the Financial Conduct Authority for business energy claims.</strong> This is a commercial claims service.</p>
<ul>

  <li>Registered address: 5 Eagle Fold, Hyde, England, SK14 4GU</li>
  <li>Contact: <a href="mailto:support@visiblelegal.co.uk">support@visiblelegal.co.uk</a></li>
</ul>

<p><strong>Controller:</strong> For the purposes of UK data protection law, Visible Legal Marketing Limited is the data controller of your personal/business data. You can contact our <strong>Data Protection Lead</strong> at <a href="mailto:support@visiblelegal.co.uk">support@visiblelegal.co.uk</a>.</p>

<h3>2. Purpose of This Policy</h3>
<p>This policy explains how we collect, use, store, and share your information when you use our Business Energy Claim Checker, sign a Letter of Authority (LOA), upload documents, or otherwise contact us about a business energy claim. <strong>This service is not FCA-regulated.</strong></p>

<h3>3. The Data We Collect</h3>
<p>We may collect:</p>
<ul>
  <li>Business details (business name, type, registration number)</li>
  <li>Contact details (contact name, email, phone)</li>
  <li>Energy contract details (supplier, contract dates, contract length, contract status)</li>
  <li>Business address and trading address</li>
  <li>Description of the issue or mis-selling concern</li>
  <li>Supporting documents you upload (e.g., energy contracts, bills, correspondence)</li>
  <li>LOA status and signed LOA PDF</li>
  <li>Marketing source and consent preferences</li>
  <li>Interaction logs (e.g., contact events, case status updates)</li>
  <li>Technical data from essential cookies; analytics cookies only with consent (see Cookies)</li>
</ul>

<h3>4. How We Collect Your Data</h3>
<p>Directly from you (our forms, email, SMS/WhatsApp, phone). We may also receive updates from specialist commercial solicitors handling your claim and from your energy supplier where you have authorised disclosure.</p>

<h3>5. How We Use Your Data</h3>
<ul>
  <li>Assess your potential business energy mis-selling claim</li>
  <li>Generate and send your LOA for e-signature where required</li>
  <li>Provide you a secure link to upload supporting documents (optional)</li>
  <li>Share your information with a specialist commercial solicitor to review and progress your claim</li>
  <li>Communicate with you about your case via email and, where applicable, SMS/WhatsApp</li>
  <li>Maintain internal audit and case-management logs</li>
  <li>Improve our services and website (analytics only with consent)</li>
</ul>
<p><em>Automated steps:</em> certain steps (e.g., sending the LOA, issuing document-upload links, logging status changes, and routing data to our systems) are automated. We do not carry out automated decision-making that produces legal or similarly significant effects.</p>
<p><em>Controller roles:</em> We act as the controller for our processing activities. Once your data is shared with a solicitor, that firm acts as an <strong>independent controller</strong> for its legal services.</p>

<h3>6. Lawful Basis</h3>
<p>Our primary basis is <strong>consent</strong> (UK GDPR Art. 6(1)(a)) for claim assessment, contacting you, and sharing information with commercial solicitors. We may also rely on:</p>
<ul>
  <li><strong>Legitimate interests</strong> (Art. 6(1)(f)) for commercial claims assessment, fraud prevention, security, service improvement, and maintaining audit logs (balanced against your rights)</li>
  <li><strong>Contract</strong> (Art. 6(1)(b)) where we enter into an agreement with you for claims services</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Note:</strong> We do NOT rely on FCA regulatory obligations as a lawful basis for this service because business energy claims are unregulated.</p>
<p>You can withdraw consent at any time by emailing <a href="mailto:support@visiblelegal.co.uk">support@visiblelegal.co.uk</a>. Withdrawal does not affect prior processing.</p>
